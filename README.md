Yeah, hi. I've been a hobbyist programmer of sorts on and off since 2008. I've used many languages to varying extents, everything from 65816 ASM (yes, [asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) is better than xkas smd) to Rust. I've tried out a number of languages: Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Object Pascal, GoLang, and many others. But for the most part to this day I use Python, C, C++, and ~~ Batch ~~ PowerShell for a majority of my weird little projects.
